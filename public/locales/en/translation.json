    "aboutText": "Hi! I'm Jennifer Baumgart — a Front-End Developer and UI/UX Designer passionate about turning ideas into engaging digital experiences. With a toolkit that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS, TypeScript, and Figma, I create responsive, accessible, and visually appealing interfaces. Curious by nature and detail-obsessed by habit, I bridge design and development to deliver seamless experiences. Whether tweaking a layout or squashing a bug, my focus is always on clarity, usability, and real impact. Currently, I'm diving deeper into React and design systems, and I love building tools that make life easier, smarter, and more beautiful."
